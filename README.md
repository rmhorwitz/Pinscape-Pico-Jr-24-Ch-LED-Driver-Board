# Pinscape-Pico-Jr-24-Ch-LED-Driver-Board
This 24 Ch LED Driver Board is an expansion board for the Pinscape Pico Jr.  This expansion board uses the expansion port on the Pinscape Pico Jr to recieve commands for controlling each of the 24 PWM channels.  This board also requires an external power supply of either or both 5V and 12V supplies.  There are 16 PWM LED driver outputs that are rated at .5A per each channel. There are also 8 more PWM channels that are doubled up ULN2803A drivers to provide 1A per channel.  This circuit is a modified version that was first created by Michael J Roberts, as such the name Pinscape Pico applies.  This repository contains all the fabrication files to create this project.
